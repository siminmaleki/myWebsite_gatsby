You as a developer may always use ORMs for CRUD operations, but I believe there is a need for every developer to have at least a basic knowledge about databases and queries as there may be some limitations with ORMs when you get into complicated queries.

Anyhow, I'm not talking about ORMs vs DB Queries in this post. so, if you are a DBA or you are interested in using SQL server, a relational Database Management System for your back-end, it's important to consider a few things to have a well-designed database and good performance. Also, if you are manipulating data as a data-scientist, data analyst and so, it's important to know how to write efficient queries.

Every piece of this document can be expanded and explained in more detail. Lots of good articles and posts are available in each. I wanted to be brief and just mention the important parts.

In this post, I'm going to mention some tips when designing databases for your project.

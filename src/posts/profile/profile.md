I am from Iran and very proud of that. Iran has an amazing nature, natural resources and friendly people who always do their best to make a wonderful time for their guests. we have delicious dishes you will never test anywhere in the world; so, do not hesitate to knock the door here. Guests are always welcomed !

By the way, I have Master's in Information Technology Management and Bachelor's in Computer Software. Furthermore, I have some Microsoft certificates e.g. MCSD, MCP, MCTS and MCAD.

During my Master's, I started to teach BPM, BPR and BPMN and it became one of my beloved activites I have been doing since then, extended to Process Mining during the last year.

I have a vast knowledge and experience in software development involved in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), also Business Process Management, Relational Databases, Data Analytics and Microsoft Technologies.

I have worked in various industries as full-stack developer, BPMS expert, Team Leader, Consultant and Teacher.

From December 2019, I have been working as self-employed; performing teaching activities, research, consultancy and software projects. During this Covidy time, I couldn't work as full-time because I had to take care of my kids at home so most of what I've been doing are remote since then.

Before Covid, I had worked as full-time and also part-time as BPM consultant in various cooperations e.g. University of Tehran for about 3 years, etc.

I have worked full-time as senior BPMS expert and later on as the head of Information Systems for 4 years at PEDEX Drilling which is an upstream Oil company. It was an amazing time regarding experiences as I was in charge of using new technologies for enhancing the quality of maintaining and using data and also accelerating the business processes, also it was a good time for gaining experiences in performing managerial tasks.

Before that, I had worked as Software and Information Systems Expert / Full-Stack Developer at TAM Engineering & Construction Company (TAM Iran Khodro) for about 8 years. At first, When I was employed as an office assistant at TAM, I was 20 years old. I studied at university while working as full-time; it was really a hard time but sweet because meanwhile, I could promote myself to be a software developer!

Before the age of 20, I had some experiences as translator, enterpreter and English teacher for kids. This period is one of those lovely experiences I never forget.

If I want to talk about my interests I would say I love teaching and also practical research and the moment academia and industry meet. It is my everlasting desire to apply research results in reality either for improvement of Information Systems or for cooperations to better apply and adopt new technologies. The topics I am interested to do research on are Process Mining and new techologies and digital innovations. Furthermore, I
can never ignore loving programming and software development even if I just do personal projects.

I have done a few research activities where you could find them in research page.

Thank you for reading my background which I call it a gradient theme from technology to management.

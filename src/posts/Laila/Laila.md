The death of my lovely sister at the age of 43 has been the bitterest event happened to me so far. I lost her for rediculous reasons and I still can't believe it.
<br/>

Anyway, in this post I don't want to say how horrible it was all; but I want to say why she passed away? How she could survive from death? What were the root causes of her death? and what I learned? It might be useful for other people to survive in a similar situation.
